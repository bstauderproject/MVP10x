# Operator Terminal Vision Memo

> Be a canvas for every working person to create a masterpiece.

The Operator Terminal isn't just productivity software — it's an OS for the post-job world.

- Jobs aren't hours — they're **functions**
- Work isn't managed top-down — it's **executed from the edge**
- Talent isn't hired — it's **deployed**

## Strategic Goals
- Enable individuals to manage multiple contracts via Terminal
- Arm them with composable AI agents to fulfill scope
- Allow them to pitch themselves to roles using scoped output
- Offer organizations internal access to terminals to scale teams without scaling headcount

## Key Principles
- Composability over rigidity
- Context over control
- Operator-as-platform, not as resume
- Output > effort

## Future Vision
- Terminal per worker
- Agents per function
- Org per intent
