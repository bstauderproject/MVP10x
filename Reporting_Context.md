# Reporting & Organizational Context Mapping

## Goal
Enable operator-generated work to be reported to the correct upstream roles based on org structure and company context.

## Metadata per Project
- `company_stage`: Seed, Series A, Public, etc.
- `company_size`: 1–10, 10–100, etc.
- `sector`: SaaS, eComm, Fintech, etc.
- `org_structure`: Flat, Matrixed, Top-down
- `reporting_to`: “CMO”, “VP of Product”, etc.

## Heuristic Usage
- Adjust tone/format of deliverables
- Prioritize agents based on stakeholder needs
- Map operator scope to likely metrics

## Example
> CMO + SaaS + Series A  
→ Report = Weekly dashboards + summary bullets  
→ Agents = `CampaignAgent`, `AnalyticsAgent`, `ColdEmailAgent`
